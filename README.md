# lea
lea is a cute backdoor, it looks for available networks, including printers
and all internet connected devices, enter it self to the registry under:"SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run"
as to run on system start-up, opens up port-8000 & listen for incoming command to execute as admin.
lea is a google software and as such it has its own digital signiture, with sha-1 on RSA.
lea passes the newest norton anti-virus scan, and doesn't ask for permission to open up ports
and to register at the windows current config. 
download lea, she's the best!
